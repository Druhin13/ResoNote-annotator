Do I move? Do I look like that?\n\n(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)\n\nI can't remember what I'm good at\n\n(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)\n\nWhere you at? Where you at?\n\n(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)\n\nWhere you at?\n\n(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)\n\n\n\nI keep looking in the mirror\n\n'Til I see myself, I see myself, eh\n\nHey lover, will you blow my cover?\n\n'Cause I'm not myself, I'm not myself, I\n\nWake up in the middle of the night\n\nAnd I look like a stranger in the bathroom light, I\n\nI keep looking in the mirror 'til I see myself\n\n\n\nPeople love, people leave, people let down\n\nPeople show up, roll up, people grow up\n\nPeople move out, people disappear\n\nPeople don't change, people rearrange\n\nPeople miss the game, people lose\n\nPeople try, people lie, can't look you in the eye\n\nPeople suck, people fuck, people leave their shit behind\n\nPeople throw up on the carpet, people trip up on the stairs\n\nPeople laugh, people dare, people scare, people tell you what to wear\n\nPeople jump, people sink, people float, people think\n\nPeople fail, people hate what they don't know\n\nPeople think they're worth nothing, people think they're worth the top\n\nPeople drop, people love what they know, people think but don't stop\n\n\n\nI keep looking in the mirror\n\n'Til I see myself, I see myself, eh\n\nHey lover, will you blow my cover?\n\n'Cause I'm not myself, I'm not myself, I\n\nWake up in the middle of the night\n\nAnd I look like a stranger in the bathroom light, I\n\nI keep looking in the mirror 'til I see myself, I see myself, eh\n\n\n\nI keep looking in the mirror\n\n'Til I see myself, I see myself, eh\n\nHey lover, will you blow my cover?\n\n'Cause I'm not myself, I'm not myself, I\n\nWake up in the middle of the night\n\nAnd I look like a stranger in the bathroom light, I\n\nI keep looking in the mirror 'til I see myself, I see myself, eh",
